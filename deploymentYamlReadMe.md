## Explanation of deployment.yaml

This is a Kubernetes deployment configuration file written in YAML. It's used to define the desired state for your application's deployments and services in a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of its components:

Namespace: This section defines a namespace called default. Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.

Frontend Deployment: This section defines a deployment for the frontend of your application. It specifies that there should be 1 replica of the pod running. The pod is using an image from your ECR URI and it exposes port 3000. It also sets environment variables for AWS credentials from a Kubernetes secret named aws-credentials.

Frontend Service: This section defines a service for the frontend deployment. It exposes the frontend deployment on a network port (port 3000) within the cluster. It's of type LoadBalancer, which means it will be exposed to the internet via a cloud provider's load balancer.

Backend Deployment: Similar to the frontend deployment, this section defines a deployment for the backend of your application. It also specifies 1 replica of the pod, uses an image from your ECR URI, exposes port 3002, and sets AWS credentials from the aws-credentials secret.

Backend Service: This section defines a service for the backend deployment. It exposes the backend deployment on a network port (port 3002) within the cluster. It's of type ClusterIP, which means it's only reachable within the cluster.

Remember to replace <your-ecr-uri-for-frontend> and <your-ecr-uri-for-backend> with your actual ECR URIs.

You can create a Kubernetes Secret to store your AWS credentials using the kubectl command-line tool. Here's how you can do it:

`kubectl create secret generic aws-credentials \
--from-literal=accessKeyId=<your-access-key-id> \
--from-literal=secretAccessKey=<your-secret-access-key>
`

Replace <your-access-key-id> and <your-secret-access-key> with your actual AWS access key ID and secret access key.

This command will create a Secret named aws-credentials in your current Kubernetes namespace. The Secret will have two keys: accessKeyId and secretAccessKey, each containing the corresponding AWS credential.

You can then reference this Secret in your Kubernetes deployment configuration to set environment variables.
